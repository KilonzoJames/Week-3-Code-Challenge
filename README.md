## Week 3 Code Challenge

## Core Deliverables
As a user, I can:

See the first movie's details, including its **poster, title, runtime,
   showtime, and available tickets** when the page loads. The number of

   available tickets will need to be derived by subtracting the number of

   `tickets_sold` from the theater's `capacity`. You will need to make a GET

   request to the following endpoint to retrieve the film data:

  

   GET /films/1

   Example Response:

   {

     "id": "1",

     "title": "The Giant Gila Monster",

     "runtime": "108",

     "capacity": 30,

     "showtime": "04:00PM",

     "tickets_sold": 27,

     "description": "A giant lizard terrorizes a rural Texas community and a heroic teenager attempts to destroy the creature.",

     "poster": "https://www.gstatic.com/tv/thumb/v22vodart/2157/p2157_v_v8_ab.jpg"

   }

See a menu of all movies on the left side of the page in the `ul#films`
   element when the page loads. (_optional_: you can style each film in the list

   by adding the classes `film item` to each `li` element.) There is a

   placeholder `li` in the `ul#films` element that is hardcoded in the HTML —

   feel free to remove that element by editing the HTML file directly, or use

   JavaScript to remove the placeholder element before populating the list. You

   will need to make a GET request to the following endpoint to retrieve the

   film data:

   GET /films

   Example response:

   [

      {

        "id": "1",

        "title": "The Giant Gila Monster",

        "runtime": "108",

        "capacity": 30,

        "showtime": "04:00PM",

        "tickets_sold": 27,

        "description": "A giant lizard terrorizes a rural Texas community and a heroic teenager attempts to destroy the creature.",

        "poster": "https://www.gstatic.com/tv/thumb/v22vodart/2157/p2157_v_v8_ab.jpg"

      },

      {

        "id": "2",

        "title": "Manos: The Hands Of Fate",

        "runtime": "118",

        "capacity": 50,

        "showtime": "06:45PM",

        "tickets_sold": 44,

        "description": "A family gets lost on the road and stumbles upon a hidden, underground, devil-worshiping cult led by the fearsome Master and his servant Torgo.",

        "poster": "https://www.gstatic.com/tv/thumb/v22vodart/47781/p47781_v_v8_ac.jpg"

      }

   ]

Buy a ticket for a movie. After clicking the "Buy Ticket" button, I should
   see the number of available tickets decreasing on the frontend. I should not

   be able to buy a ticket if the showing is sold out (if there are 0 tickets

   available). **No persistence is needed for this feature**.
